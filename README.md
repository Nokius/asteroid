AsteroidOS build system
=======================

[AsteroidOS](http://asteroidos.org) is a free and open-source smartwatch platform based on OpenEmbedded, libhybris and Qt5.

You can fully build a flashable image from source with the following commands, but be careful it will take several hours:

    . ./prepare-build.sh <codename of your watch>
    bitbake asteroid-image

For more information report to [the documentation](https://asteroidos.org/wiki/documentation/).

Stay tuned about the project on IRC: #asteroid on irc.freenode.net and Twitter: [@AsteroidOS](http://twitter.com/AsteroidOS) .
